filtered	acPerTask	acPerTaskCond	= first perf.timestamp listRef/appendingRef?




appending on a filter:

appendedVal	filter.v1	commaref



list with filter vals in it


listRef
	block1
	appendedValBlock
	block3

block3	 	filter.v3

appendedValBlock	filter.v1	parenthesesRef

Replace one filter with another's vals? two reference filters/tsvs
	perhaps just start at first element, proceed to end
	yes, only apply when using filtered term, otherwise the original flow would be destroyed


filtered	acpertask	acpertaskcond	= appendedVal	= listRef
