Or put this in filtered only? list as columns description when retreiving
retrieveflow	flowref	columnslist
column1appended	flowref.col3	commaref
filtered	flowref	= column1appended


appending on a filter, any appending that has a filter being appended:

appendedVal	filter.v1	commaref

Listref(Flow)
	appendedVal
	val2


list with filter vals in it


listRef
	block1
	appendedValBlock
	block3

block3	 	filter.v3

appendedValBlock	filter.v1	parenthesesRef

Replace one filter with another's vals? two reference filters/tsvs
	perhaps just start at first element, proceed to end
	yes, only apply when using filtered term, otherwise the original flow would be destroyed


filtered	acpertask	acpertaskcond	= appendedVal	= listRef
